## Sourdough at home

  Having tried sever times to get my sourdough right, I am making notes here. 
You can message me suggestions or corrections.

  To me its necessary to understand the whole process of spontaneous fermentation, to cuturing a sour.
so this is my third attempt, and maybe it works first time.

As a control (cheat) I have my old one for comparison, so I am just going to get that one going again. Its been sat in my fridge for over two years, and has a grey hairy mold on top, and smells of vomit so its probably perfect.
so I throw the top mold away (which is probably incorrect but I dont want a contaminated starter) and only use whats underneath.

I make a new paste using 100g cold water and 50 g boiling, and a good pinch of salt - maybe even a heaped teaspoon, to which I add 50g organic wholemeal flour. It has to be organic, if you use non organic flour it may contain anti fungal which will kill the sour.

so terminology = 'sour' is the paste you use as a starter and feed and grow daily.

so I pour the remainder of the contents of my stale old starter into the new paste and pop the lid on. Place it in a warmish corner of the kitchen and wait. After an hour or so the thing is bubbling again, and has a nice pasty earth smell.

Day 2, I feed the thing with another batch of paste made as before, and split it in two. One goes back in the fridge after 8 hours, and stays there forever.
