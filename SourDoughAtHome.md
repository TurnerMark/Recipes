## Sourdough at home

  Having tried sever times to get my sourdough right, I am making notes here. 
You can message me suggestions or corrections.

# Starting your own culture.

  To me its necessary to understand the whole process of spontaneous fermentation, to culturing a sour.
so this is my third attempt, and maybe it works this time.

As a control (cheat) I have my old one for comparison, so I am just going to get that one going again. Its been sat in my fridge for over two years, and has a grey hairy mold on top, and smells of vomit so its probably perfect.
so I throw the top mold away (which is probably incorrect but I dont want a contaminated starter) and only use whats underneath.

I make a new paste using 100g cold water and 50 g boiling, and a good pinch of salt - maybe even a heaped teaspoon, to which I add 50g organic wholemeal flour. It has to be organic, if you use non organic flour it may contain anti fungal which will kill the sour.

so terminology = 'sour' is the paste you use as a starter and feed and grow daily.

so I pour the remainder of the contents of my stale old starter into the new paste and pop the lid on. Place it in a warmish corner of the kitchen and wait. After an hour or so the thing is bubbling again, and has a nice pasty earth smell.

Day 2, I feed the thing with another batch of paste made as before, and split it in two. One goes back in the fridge after 8 hours, and stays there forever.

    so my basic feed is a brine feed made with 70g hot and 30g cool water to give 77C brine with 5g sea salt - so a 5% brine into which I put 50g organic stneground flour. In ancient times of course people would have put whatever grain and seed they gathered into their sour, and perhaps carried it with them. The brine fermentation favours Lactobacillus bacteria, so they will produce lactic acid instead of acetic acid, the fermentation in brine allows the enzymes to act without feeding the fermentation yeasts too quickly.
    when the sponge is made the next day using equal parts of flour and sourr, the first part of the fermentation is done in a polythene bag, so preventing fresh oxygen getting into the batch, and further conditioning the culture to favour the anaerobic lactobacillus.
    after the dough has proved, it should be workable, and the process of kneading and the introduction of fresh food (flour) to the mix also adds oxygen so the production of the aerobic yeast will be enabled, also the reduction in salinity overall should boos yeast growth.
    The second stage of fermentation is slow, todays loaf was four hours at stage 1, and only 2 at stage 2, tomorrow I add an hour to see how it changes.
